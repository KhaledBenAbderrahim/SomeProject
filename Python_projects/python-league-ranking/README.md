<h1> Sport league Ranking </1>

## The Problem

I create a command-line application that will calculate the
ranking table for a sports league.

### Input/output

The input and output is a  text. The solution  parse the provided
sample-input.txt file via stdin (pipe or redirect) . the  solution  output the correct result via
stdout to the console.

The input contains results of games, one per line. See sample-input.txt for
details. The output is ordered from most to least points


### The rules

A draw (tie) is worth 1 point and a win is worth 3 points. A
loss is worth 0 points. If two or more teams have the same number of points,
they should have the same rank and be printed in alphabetical order (as in the
tie for 3rd place in the sample data).
